          <h2>1.<span>Making the Decision to Switch</span></h2>
          <p>You should only more forward with Canvas if and when you have
            determined that we far outperform other vendors and offer an
            unmatched return on investment. Our goal is to give you as much
            information as possible to make this de determionation one way or
            other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application
            for you to get a feel for the plataform as well as references to
            current customers to talk about their experience.

          <h2>2.<span>Interfaces and Community Integration</span></h2>
          <p>Canvas is meant to imntegrate with your existing interfaces and
            community resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax
            number, enrolling your payers with our clearinghouse, and getting
            biderectional lab feeds running. We'll also load your preferred
            specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that sending
            referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces
            with health information exchanges or other information technology
            vendors are important, we will work with you to determine what we
            can deliver and when.

          <h2>3.<span>Data Migration</span></h2>
          <p>The first thing we will do is gain acess to a full backup of your
            current data, which we have executed successfully with boith
            remotely hosted and on-premise EMR databases. Then  our work begins
            to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and information like
            medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightfoward.
            While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging,
            our team has been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with
            a wide variety of EMRs.

          <p>We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including
            clinical content, charge schedules, and much more. Role-based
            training will be done a few weeks pior to go-live to familiarize
            relevant team members with clinical, practice management, and
            billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our
            team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on
            implementation and training.
